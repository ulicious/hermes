# e.g. [[result_1, results_2], [results_2, results_3]]
# comparison plots --> 1x2 or 2x2 plots. Nested lists with each list containing up to 4 results (names of results); e.g. [['results_1', 'results_2'], ['results_1', 'results_2', 'results_3', 'results_4']]

solving_time_plot; list with result names; creates plot with boxplot for each result to show solving time in minutes

# direct comparison plots: results are compared with each other. Nested lists with each list containing results (names of result); e.g. [['results_1', 'results_2'], ['results_1', 'results_2', 'results_3', 'results_4']]
matched_supply_routes_plots: []  # compares results and attaches routes to the destination which has cheapest supply costs of route
