Assumption / Setting;Values;Explanation;Comment
enforce_update_of_data;True / False;If True, only techno-economic data (conversion costs at locations) will be updated. If False, infrastructure will be calculated as well;
update_only_conversion_costs_and_efficiency;True / False;If True, only techno-economic data (conversion costs at locations) will be updated. If False, infrastructure will be calculated as well;
low_temp_heat_available_at_ports;True / False;Indicates if low-temperature heat is available at ports;
mid_temp_heat_available_at_ports;True / False;Indicates if medium-temperature heat is available at ports;
high_temp_heat_available_at_ports;True / False;Indicates if high-temperature heat is available at ports;
low_temp_heat_available_at_pipelines;True / False;Indicates if low-temperature heat is available at pipelines;
mid_temp_heat_available_at_pipelines;True / False;Indicates if medium-temperature heat is available at pipelines;
high_temp_heat_available_at_pipelines;True / False;Indicates if high-temperature heat is available at pipelines;
minimal_distance_between_pipeline_connection_points;integer;In meter. Maximal distance between feed-in points in pipelines;Higher number will result in more options and might result in longer calculation times
