Assumption / Setting;Values;Explanation;Comment
target_commodity;list;Indicate which commodities at destination are desired;
tolerance_distance;integer / math.inf;In meters. Indicates within which distances a branch is at location. If distance smaller than tolerance, infrastructure can be used directly;
to_final_destination_tolerance;integer / math.inf;In meters. Indicates within which distances a branch is at destination. If distance smaller than tolerance, branch is at destination;
max_length_new_segment;integer / math.inf;In meters. Indicates which maximal distance can be covered with new pipelines;
max_length_road;integer / math.inf;In meters. Indicates which maximal distance can be covered by road transport;
no_road_multiplier;float;Indicates by which factor new pipelines and road transport is multiplied to consider rerouting due to obstacles;
build_new_infrastructure;True / False;If True, new pipelines can be built;
H2_ready_infrastructure;True / False;If True, existing natural gas pipelines can be used for hydrogen transport;
low_temp_heat_available_at_destination;True / False;Indicates if low-temperature heat is available at destination;
mid_temp_heat_available_at_destination;True / False;Indicates if medium-temperature heat is available at destination;
high_temp_heat_available_at_destination;True / False;Indicates if high-temperature heat is available at destination;
print_runtime_information;True / False;If True, regular updates on branches is given while code is running;
print_benchmark_info;True / False;If True, information on initial benchmark for each location is given;
