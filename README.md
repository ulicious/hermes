PtX transport is a multi-commodity multi mean of transport algorithm, capable to find the most cost-effective transportation route from pre-defined starting points to a desired location. The algorithm derives possible solutions for transportation from a starting point to the final destination. Based on the underlying infrastructure data, the algorithm iteratively explores infrastructure nodes and calculates costs for each reached nodes. It terminates as soon as it reaches the final destination and exploration to other nodes is not possible anymore.

The algorithm is not dependend on a specific dataset. However,
