PtX transport is a multi-commodity multi mean of transport algorithm, capable to find the most cost-effective transportation route from pre-defined starting points to a desired location. The algorithm derives possible solutions for transportation from a starting point to the final destination. Iteratively, new decisions are taken based on conversions and routes which will end in a decision tree where each branch is created based on the choice of conversion or transportation.
